# hello-dist-sys

This sample application is meant to be used as a resource for learning about distributed systems concepts in Go.

It is based on the content in Travis Jeffery's book [Distributed Services with Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/), with modifications as I go along to make things more comprehensible for myself and other developers new to distributed systems concepts. 

I have added comments to certain lines which a more experienced developer may think of as overkill, but my goal is to not let anyone feel left behind in learning these concepts.
