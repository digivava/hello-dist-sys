# hello-dist-sys

This sample application is meant to be used as a resource for learning about distributed systems concepts in Go.

The code is based on the content in Travis Jeffery's book [Distributed Services with Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/), with modifications to make things more comprehensible for myself and other developers new to distributed systems concepts. 

I've added my own editorial readmes to describe various concepts to developers who are new to them. Similarly, I have added comments to certain lines throughout the code which a more experienced developer may think of as overkill, but my goal is to not let anyone feel left behind in learning these concepts!

## Concepts

Click the items in the list below to be directed to the readme for the part of the code where that concept is used.
